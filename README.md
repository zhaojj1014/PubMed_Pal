# PubMed Pal: an AI-Powered Content Generation App for Small Businesses

## Description

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to PubMed Pal! 

I created this app to help small business owners to create educational blog posts for their target customers. 
This is a project for fun and is not a final product. There's a lot that can be improved to make this app better. ðŸ¤— 

**Take results with a grain of** ðŸ§‚

The app is developed using Streamlit for frontend, and PubMed API and Openai API in the backend. It asks the user to input topics and target audience, and then search recent research articles on life sciences and biomedical topics through PubMed API. Then it selects the abstracts of three articles from the search results and prompts the LLM to write a blog article based on the provided abstracts for the user-specified audience. Finally it appends the references to the LLM-generated blog post. To see how PubMed Pal works in action, watch the [demo](https://youtu.be/-EL-QTZ2I5g).
